# PlatformSpoofer

Allows for spoofing the platform you are connecting to Discord with.

## Usage

Select the platform you wish to spoof in the settings, disconnect from the Discord websocket, then reconnect;
This will show another platform until the other websocket connection fully dies, if you want it to not show 
temporarily then swap to another account, change the platform, and swap back (via account switcher)
